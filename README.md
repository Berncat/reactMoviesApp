## Setup requirements.

[ Briefly state (to a third party) the setup steps necessary to run your app/client locally, e.g. .env and any other config files.]

### Views/Pages.

[ For each view in your app, show a screenshot and caption - only new/modified ones in the case of the Movies Fan app. If necessary, use multiple screenshots to cover a view's full capability.
